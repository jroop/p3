===============================

###Background
Udacity front-enf game that has been enhanced. It sort of resembles a classic frogger game.

Thanks for playing and enjoy!

###Game Play
* Use `enter` key to start game and pause game
* Use keyboard arrows `up`, `down`, `left`, and `right` to move the character

__NOTE__: If running game from a static file then the grayscale coloring during game pause will not work. This is a limitation of the browser as it is considered a security error. It is best to run the game from a server then all problems go away.
